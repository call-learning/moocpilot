üç™ front-end-cookie-cutter üç™
=============================

Please tag **@edx/fedx-team** on any PRs or issues.

Introduction
------------

The purpose of this repository is to illustrate general front-end best
practices for ```React`` <https://reactjs.org/>`__ and
```Redux`` <https://redux.js.org>`__ applications using a handful of
(overly) simplified examples.

We are currently using ``node v8.9.3`` and ``npm@5.5.1``.

Getting Started
---------------

After cloning the repository, run ``make up-detached`` in the
``front-end-cookie-cutter`` directory - this will build and start the
``front-end-cookie-cutter`` web application in a docker container.

Hopefully, the output looks something like

   make-up-detached-output

The web application runs on port **1991**, but some parts of it require
authentication with the openedx platform so when you go to
``http://localhost:1991/public`` you should see something like

   hello-world

If you don‚Äôt, you can see the log messages for the docker container by
executing ``make logs`` in the ``front-end-cookie-cutter`` directory.
This should output something like

.. figure:: https://imgur.com/JDUEkZ3.png
   :alt: make-logs

   make-logs

Note that ``make up-detached`` executes the ``npm run start`` script
which will hot-reload JavaScript and Sass files changes, so you should
(:crossed_fingers:) not need to do anything (other than wait) when
making changes.

Connection with the openedx Platform Authentication
---------------------------------------------------

-  Start by setting up the openedx
   ```Devstack`` <https://github.com/edx/devstack>`__
-  Once the devstack is up and running you should be able to log in
   using the redirects configured in ``config/webpack.dev.config.js``
-  If the application is configured correctly, accessing a url in the
   PrivateRoutes list like ``http://localhost:1991`` should redirect you
   to the LMS Login.
-  Once you are logged in you should be able to go back to
   ``http://localhost:1991`` and you should see the page without being
   redirected to log in.

``.babelrc``
~~~~~~~~~~~~

We use ```Babel`` <https://babeljs.io/>`__ to transpile ``ES2015+``
JavaScript to ``ES5`` JavaScript. ``ES5`` JavaScript has `greater
browser compatibility <http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es5/>`__
than ```ES2015+`` <http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/>`__.

The ``.babelrc`` file is used to specify a particular configuration -
for example, we use the
```babel-preset-react`` <https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/preset-react/>`__,
which, among other things, allows ``babel`` to parse ``JSX``.

``.dockerignore``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The important thing to remember is to add the ``node_modules`` directory
to ``.dockerignore`` - for more information `see the Docker
documentation <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#dockerignore-file>`__.

``.eslintignore``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We use ```eslint`` <https://eslint.org/>`__ for our ``JavaScript``
linting needs. The ``.eslintignore`` file is used to `specify files or
directories to, well,
ignore <https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring#ignoring-files-and-directories>`__.

While ``eslint`` automatically ignores ``node_modules``, we like to add
it to the ``.eslintignore`` just for the added explicitness. In
addition, you probably want to add the directory for your compiled files
(in our case, ``./dist``) and your coverage directory (in our case,
``./coverage``).

``.eslintrc``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is where the actual ``eslint`` configuration is specified. All
``edX`` JavaScript projects should extend either the
```eslint-config-edx`` <https://github.com/edx/eslint-config-edx/blob/master/packages/eslint-config-edx/README.md>`__
or
```eslint-config-edx-es5`` <https://github.com/edx/eslint-config-edx/blob/master/packages/eslint-config-edx-es5/README.md>`__
configurations (for ``ES2015+`` and ``ES5`` JavaScript, respectively).
Both configurations can be found in `the ``eslint-config-edx``
repository <https://github.com/edx/eslint-config-edx>`__.

``.npmignore``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We are not currently publishing this package to
```npm`` <https://www.npmjs.com/>`__. If we did, we would want to
exclude certain files from getting uploaded to ``npm`` (like our
coverage files, for example). For more information, see `the ``npm``
documentation <https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/developers#keeping-files-out-of-your-package>`__.

``.travis.yml``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We use ```Travis CI`` <https://travis-ci.org/>`__ to build (and deploy)
our application. The ``.travis.yml`` file specifies the configuration
for ``Travis`` builds. For more information, see `the ``Travis``
documentation <https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/customizing-the-build/>`__.

``package.json``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Arguably, one of the **most important files in an ``npm``-based
application**, the ``package.json`` file specifies everything from the
``name`` of the application, were it to be published to ``npm``, to it‚Äôs
``dependencies``.

For more information, see `the ``npm``
documentation <https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json>`__.

Helpful Applications
--------------------

```Greenkeeper`` <https://greenkeeper.io/>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

```Greenkeeper`` <https://greenkeeper.io/>`__ is basically a ``GitHub``
application that handles ``npm`` dependencies. It will automatically
open PRs with ``package.json`` and ``package-lock.json`` updates when
new versions of your ``npm`` dependencies get published.

For more information, see `the ``Greenkeeper``
documentation <https://greenkeeper.io/docs.html#what-greenkeeper-does>`__.

Authentication with backend API services
----------------------------------------

See the
```@edx/frontend-auth`` <https://github.com/edx/frontend-auth>`__ repo
for information about securing routes in your application that require
user authentication.

Other documentation
-------------------

See additional documentation in the `docs <./docs>`__ directory, including help on i18n.
